# Bidirectional conversion between JSON(-LD) and iRODS AVUs

## Introduction

This is a companion repository to the [irods_avu_json](https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json) Python 
module. Please read the README of that repository for an introduction on the goal of these repositories.

The repository [irods_avu_json-ruleset](https://github.com/MaastrichtUniversity/irods_avu_json) contains the iRODS rules, policies and microservices to make the conversion code operational in iRODS.

This repository binds everything together in a docker example.
